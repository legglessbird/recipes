How to Make a Soft Boiled Egg

1. Use a small saucepan. Place eggs in the pan, and fill with enough cold water to cover the eggs by about 1/2 inch (1cm).

2. Bring to a boil on high heat. When the water boils, reduce the heat to low so that you have a gentle simmer.

3.  Cook until done. Using a timer, follow the timing below to get the results you desire:

    2 minutes: very soft yolk and egg white
    3 minutes: the white is just set, and the yolk is just starting to thicken
    4 minutes: the white and yolk are set, with the center of the yolk still creamy
    Note: if your eggs are very fresh (1-5 days old), add an additional 30 seconds to the above times.
